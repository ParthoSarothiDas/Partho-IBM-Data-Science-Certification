    "Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know that: \n",
    "\n",
    "Python can distinguish among data types such as integers, floats, strings, and Booleans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers are whole numbers that can be positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Floats are numbers that have decimal points; they can represent whole or fractional values.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can convert integers to floats using typecasting and vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can convert integers and floats to strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can convert an integer or float to a Boolean: 0 becomes False, non-zero becomes True.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions in Python are a combination of values and operations used to produce a single result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use // to perform integer division, which results in an integer value by discarding the fractional part.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python follows the order of operations (BODMAS) to perform operations with multiple expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables store and manipulate data, allowing you to access and modify values throughout your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment operator \"=\" assigns a value to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assigning another value to the same variable overrides the previous value of that variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can perform mathematical operations on variables using the same or different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifying the value of one variable will affect other variables only if they reference the same mutable object.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python string operations involve manipulating text data using tasks such as indexing, concatenation, slicing, and formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "A string is usually written within double quotes or single quotes, including letters, white space, digits, or special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "A string can be assigned to a variable and is an ordered sequence of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Characters in a string identify their index numbers, which can be positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are sequences that support operations like indexing and slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can input a stride value to perform slicing while operating on a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations like concatenation and replication produce new strings, while finding the length of a string returns a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot modify an existing string; they are immutable. \n",
    "\n",
    " You can use escape sequences with a backslash (\\) to change the layout of a string.  (For example, \\n for a new line, \\t for a tab, and \\\\ for a backslash, etc.)   \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you perform tasks such as searching, modifying, and formatting text data with its pre-built string methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "You apply a method to a string to change its value, resulting in another string. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can perform actions such as changing the case of characters in a string, replacing items in a string, finding items in a string, and so on using pre-built string methods."

    "Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know that: \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we often use tuples to group related data together.Tuples refer to ordered and immutable collections of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are usually written as comma-separated elements in parentheses ‚Äú()\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You can include strings, integers, and floats in tuples and access them using both positive and negative indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can perform operations such as combining, concatenating, and slicing on tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are immutable, so you need to create a new tuple to manipulate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples, termed nesting, can include other tuples of complex data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access elements in a nested tuple through indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists in Python contain ordered collections of items that can hold elements of different types and are mutable, allowing for versatile data storage and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list is an ordered sequence, represented with square brackets \"[]\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists possess mutability, rendering them akin to tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list can contain strings, integers, and floats; you can nest lists within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access each element in a list using both positive and negative indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concatenating or appending a list will result in the modification of the same list.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can perform operations such as adding, deleting, splitting, and so forth on a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can separate elements in a list using delimiters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aliasing occurs when multiple names refer to the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also clone a list to create another list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries in Python are key-value pairs that provide a flexible way to store and retrieve data based on unique keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries consist of keys and values, both composed of string elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "You denote dictionaries using curly brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The keys necessitate immutability and uniqueness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The values may be either immutable or mutable, and they allow duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "You separate each key-value pair with a comma, and you can use color highlighting to make the key more visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can assign dictionaries to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "You use the key as an argument to retrieve the corresponding value.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make additions and deletions to dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can perform an operation on a dictionary to check the key, which results in a true or false output.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can apply methods to obtain a list of keys and values in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets in Python are collections of unique elements, useful for tasks such as removing duplicates and performing set operations like union and intersection. Sets lack order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Curly brackets \"{}\" are helpful for defining elements of a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets do not contain duplicate items.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list passed through the set function generates a set containing unique elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "You use ‚ÄúSet Operations‚Äù to perform actions such as adding, removing, and verifying elements in a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine sets using the ampersand \"&\" operator to obtain the common elements from both sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the Union function to combine two sets, including both the common and unique elements from both sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sub-set method is used to determine if two or more sets are subsets."
