    "\n",

    "###  Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Purpose**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * A **DBMS** (Database Management System) not only stores data but also helps in **retrieving and organizing** it effectively.\n",
    "   * A basic query like `SELECT * FROM book;` retrieves all columns and rows but **does not guarantee any specific order**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sorting with `ORDER BY`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Use `ORDER BY` to **sort results by a specific column**.\n",
    "   * Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     SELECT title FROM book ORDER BY title;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "     * This sorts **book titles alphabetically** (ascending by default).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Descending Order**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * To reverse the sorting order, use the keyword `DESC`.\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     SELECT title FROM book ORDER BY title DESC;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sorting by Column Position**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * You can use the **column's position number** (as listed in the SELECT clause) instead of the column name:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     SELECT title, pages FROM book ORDER BY 2;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "     * This sorts by the **second column** (`pages`) in **ascending order**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Tie-breaking**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * When multiple rows have the same prefix or values, sorting continues with the next differing characters or digits.\n",

    "###  Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Eliminating Duplicates with `DISTINCT`\n",
    "\n",
    "* A `SELECT` statement may return **duplicate values**.\n",
    "* Use `DISTINCT` to return **only unique values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT DISTINCT country FROM author ORDER BY 1;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Example: From 20 authors, only 6 unique countries are shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Grouping Data with `GROUP BY`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use `GROUP BY` to **group rows with the same value** in one or more columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT country, COUNT(*) FROM author GROUP BY country;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * This groups authors by country and **counts** how many authors are from each.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Renaming Columns with `AS`\n",
    "\n",
    "* SQL can rename derived or calculated columns for **clarity**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS Count FROM author GROUP BY country;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Instead of showing `2` as a column heading, it now displays `Count`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Filtering Groups with `HAVING`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use `HAVING` to **filter grouped results** (unlike `WHERE`, which filters rows **before** grouping).\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS Count\n",
    "  FROM author\n",
    "  GROUP BY country\n",
    "  HAVING COUNT(*) > 4;\n",
    "  ```\n",
